# I want to build...

## a Chrome extension

You could try using [Plasmo](https://dev.to/plasmo/building-a-modern-react-chrome-extension-with-a-new-framework-4ho1).
- Making Chrome extensions is normally pretty annoying. Long story short: You turn on developer mode in Chrome, then you load the **unpacked** extension source code in Chrome, but Chrome doesn't refresh this automatically.
- I haven't tried Plasmo yet, but it's supposed to fix this.
